# coverage-vp

Modified version of [SymEx-VP][symex-vp github] with Concolic Line Coverage support.

More information about coverage-vp is available in the IEEE Embedded System Letters (ESL) journal publication *Towards Quantification and Visualization of the Effects of Concretization during Concolic Testing*.

## Installation

Refer to the original [installation][symex-vp install]
instructions. Contrary to vanilla SymEx-VP, this repository also
bundles a slightly modified version of [clover][clover github].

## Usage

coverage-vp is a modified version of SymEx-VP which will generate
coverage information in an enhanced version of the `gcov` JSON format
(see `--json-format` option in `gcov(1)`). The enhanced version of this
format includes information about concretizations performed during
concolic testing. This generated JSON files can be passed to
[jcovr][jcovr github] for visualization purposes. Refer to the
the aforementioned journal publication for more information.
